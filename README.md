# Getting Started with Simple Expense Tracker App

Welcome to our Simple Expense Tracker App, a practical project designed to introduce you to the world of React development. This project was created using Create React App, a fantastic tool for bootstrapping React applications.

## What's Inside

In this project, you'll find a few essential scripts to help you get started with the Expense Tracker App. Let's walk through them:

### `npm install` 

This script is your gateway to setting up the required node modules for the project. By running npm install, you ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies to make the app run smoothly.

### `npm start`

Once you've installed the required modules, you can fire up the app with npm start. This script initiates the app in development mode and, excitingly, opens it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You'll be able to see your project come to life as you work on it. Plus, thanks to hot-reloading, the page will automatically refresh whenever you make changes, making your development process as efficient as possible.

`Now that you've got the project set up, feel free to dive into the code, explore its functionality, and, most importantly, start building your own features to take this basic example to the next level. If you have any questions or need assistance along the way, don't hesitate to reach out.`

We're here to support your journey into the exciting world of React development.

Happy coding!
